She worked for the Danish Geodetic Institute and had access to data on the seismic waves generated by distant earthquakes and recorded at seismic stations around the Earth. The observed data were inconsistent with the model of the inner of the Earth used at that time. She proposed a new model compatible with the observations, with the core divided into two parts, a heavier inner core surrounded by an outer core. Some seismic waves bounce on the inner core, which is now known to be ferrous.","links":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/college.math.j.44.5.399\nhttp://mpe.dimacs.rutgers.edu/2014/02/19/how-inge-lehmann-discovered-the-inner-core-of-the-earth/"},{"id":"patterns_nature","title":"Patterns in Nature","body":"How are patterns generated in nature? Why is the tiger striped, while the leopard has spots? A single chemical model of reaction-diffusion produces all animal coating patterns. Two chemicals, an activator and an inhibitor, interact and diffuse. The model explains that the pattern observed on an embryo depends on the size and shape of the embryo when the reaction-diffusion starts. Similar reaction-diffusion models explain patterns of seashells, and also vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions. It is Alan Turing who proposed the Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in 1952.","links":"http://mpe.dimacs.rutgers.edu/2013/09/02/how-vegetation-competes-for-rainfall-in-dry-regions-using-math-models-to-make-predictions/ \nhttp://mpe.dimacs.rutgers.edu/2013/08/23/patterns-on-earth/"},{"id":"epidemics_analysis","title":"Epidemics Analysis","body":"When a new epidemic starts one can fear that it will not stop since there are always new cases. This is not what mathematics says. The important quantity is the reproductive ratio, R_0, which corresponds to the mean number of individuals infected by each infectious person. If R_0 < 1, then the epidemic dies, while it spreads if R_0 > 1. The knowledge of R_0 guides the strategy to control the epidemic. In particular, in case of limited resources (for instance not enough vaccines for everyone), the goal is to use these resources to decrease R_0 below 1.","links":"https://www.mathscareers.org.uk/article/number-one-crime-fighter/"},{"id":"four_colors_suffice","title":"Four Colors Suffice","body":"What is the minimum number of colours necessary to colour any map so that no two countries sharing a common boundary have the same colour? It is easy to draw a map for which three colours do not suffice. The minimum number of colours is four: this is the Four Colour Theorem proved in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken.
